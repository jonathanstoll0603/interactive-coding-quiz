Dynamically updated, interactive coding assessment

## Description

Many employers require potential candidates to complete a coding assessment before they are considered for the job. These assessments typically involve a quiz that goes over common programming knowledge as well as interactive coding challenges that mimic real world scenarios. 

The purpose of this application is to create an interactive quiz that asks user programming related questions, records the user's score, stores their data/highscores, and implements a time limit that stops the quiz once the limit is reached. For this project, I will be utilizing bootstrap's responsive design in order to give a user-friendly UI that seemlessly transisitions between browsers and screen sizes. Additionally, the application will utilize javascript and web APIs as to store scores, time limits, and provide input for the user's responses.
